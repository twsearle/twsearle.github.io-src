Hi,

This is my personal webpage. I recently finished a physics PhD student studying turbulence in complex fluids at the University of Edinburgh. (The image above is of a turbulent flow in a channel, drawn from my simulations. See my thesis for details)

For more information on what we did, check out my [supervisors webpage](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~amorozov/) or the [group website](http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/icmcs).

I received my funding through the [CM-CDT](http://cm-cdt.supa.ac.uk/) and we have some fun stuff we do [here](http://cm-cdt.supa.ac.uk/outreach/index.php).

I am on [github](https://github.com/twsearle) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tsearle/).
