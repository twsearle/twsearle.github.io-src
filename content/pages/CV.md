Summary: Curriculum Vitae

----

>  I am a recently graduated computational fluid mechanics PhD student
>  transitioning to a career in aerospace engineering. 


Technical Experience
--------------------

CFD

:   **Computational Fluid Mechanics**: developed spectral and pseudo-spectral algorithms for the direct numerical simulation of fluids acquired during my PhD.

Mathematical Modelling

:   **Mathematica:** Produced a low-order model of the transition to turbulence. 

:   **Stability Analysis:** Experience with both linear and nonlinear stability analysis.

Programming Languages

:   **Python:** Numerical Linear algebra using scipy, data handling using pandas and visualisation using matplotlib and paraview. 

:   **C:** Created my own direct numerical simulation code for [channel flows of viscoelastic fluids in 2D] [ref]. This program uses FFTW to implement a fully spectral Chebyshev-Fourier method. Trained in MPI and openMP parallel programming.

:   **Java:** Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Java and Computer modelling courses in the 1st and 2nd year of a university of Edinburgh physics department. 

:   Basic knowledge of **C++**, **HTML** and **Matlab**

Education
---------

2012--2016 
:   **PhD Physics: Turbulence in complex fluids**; University of Edinburgh

    *Purely elastic shear flow instabilities: linear stability, coherent states and direct numerical simulations*

    I have had the opportunity to:

    * learn in depth nonlinear dynamics as applied to fluid mechanics and turbulence
    * solve mathematical and physical problems independently and in a team environment
    * co-supervise physics research students 
    * collaborate with researchers from across the world
    * presented my research to a general physics audience through seminars within the department
    * deliver presentations on my research at international conferences

    **Potential applications:** bacterial swimming, polymer flow and manufacture, and geophysical flows.


2007--2012
:   **MPhys/Phil 1st class degree, Physics with Philosophy**; University of Manchester 

    My degree is a combined bachelors and masters, two thirds physics and one third philosophy, with two masters dissertations. My degree involved:

    * all core modules in physics, including thermodynamics, solid state physics, plasma physics and advanced statistical physics
    * project planning and C++ code development during my physics masters project
    * high quality written communication in philosophical essays and masters dissertation
    
2005--2007
:   **4 A levels **; Exeter College

    *Maths (A), Physics (A), Philosophy (A), Chemistry (B)*. Recognised as Exeter College Science Student of the Year 2007

Work Experience
---------------

2012--2016 
:   **Teaching Assistant**; University of Edinburgh

    Throughout my PhD, I have been employed by the university as a tutor and teaching assistant on multiple Java programming, physics and mathematics courses at undergraduate level. This involved:
    
    * marking \~30 assignments per week and providing useful feedback
    * tutoring groups of \~15 students 
    * working in a team with the other teaching staff to improve the content of lectures
    
07/2011--01/2012
:   **Retail Assistant**; M\&S foods ltd.

07/2010
:   **Summer Student**; Manchester Nuclear Physics Group.
    A voluntary summer project testing the properties of various detectors 

06/2008--09/2008
:   **Warehouse Assistant**; Pencarrie ltd.

2005--2007
:   **Retail Assistant**; Tesco ltd.

2005
:   **Work Experience Placement**; Met Office Hadley centre for climate research

Outreach and Community Work
---------------------------

* 2015 Editor and contributing author for the third issue of the [CM-CDT outreach magazine][ref2]
