This is my personal webpage. I am a scientific software engineer at the
Met Office with a PhD in turbulence in complex fluids from the
University of Edinburgh.

I am a member of ocean forecasting research and development at the Met
Office. I help provide weather forecasts for the oceans as well as
supporting the Met Office to gather and use ocean climate and weather
data. Please see the `Met Office
site <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/ocean-forecasting>`__
for details.

For more information on what I did during my PhD, check out my
`supervisors webpage <http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~amorozov/>`__ or the
`group website <http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/icmcs>`__.

I am on `github <https://github.com/twsearle>`__ and
`bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/tsearle/>`__.
