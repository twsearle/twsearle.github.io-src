Hi,

This is my personal webpage. I am a scientific software engineer at the Met Office with a PhD in the turbulence in complex fluids from the University of Edinburgh. (The image above is of a turbulent flow in a channel, drawn from my simulations. See my thesis for details)

I am a member of ocean forecasting research and development at the Met Office. I help provide weather forecasts for the oceans as well as supporting the Met Office to gather and use ocean climate and weather data. Please see the [Met Office site](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/weather/ocean-forecasting) for details.

For more information on what I did during my PhD, check out my [supervisors webpage](http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~amorozov/) or the [group website](http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/icmcs).

I received my funding through the [CM-CDT](http://cm-cdt.supa.ac.uk/) and we have some fun stuff we do [here](http://cm-cdt.supa.ac.uk/outreach/index.php).

I am on [github](https://github.com/twsearle) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/tsearle/).
